What I do
-
I'm a senior software engineer focusing on __backend__ development and __data__ engineering. 

I use Python for building __data pipeline__, __RESTful APIs__ and backend of __MVC__ web applications.

I code with __Agile, TDD__ methodologies and work remotely in most of my previous roles. 

A list of my skill set can be found in [my resume](https://github.com/haowu0802/About/blob/master/Resume_Senior_Software_Engineer_Hao_Leon_Wu.pdf)

Who I am
-
 
I'm a life time learner, coder and a tech geek. I started coding since junior high (MS-DOS 6.22), with modding computer games. 

I believe in moving forward in small steady steps, in life and in coding, I persistantly learn everyday.

I became close friends with most of my previous team members, and we enjoy continue working on interesting projects even after we no longer are in the same team. The relationship doesn't stop at being just co-workers.

What I'm looking for
-
A small team that is family like. A long term relationship.

A place that I can contribute my effort and craft to help making a difference.

A chance to share and learn from others, and improve the craft together.
