What I do
-
I'm a __full stack__ developer focusing on back-end development. I'm experienced with three stacks : __JavaScript/NodeJS, Python/Django, and PHP/Yii__. (A list of my skill set can be found in [my resume](https://github.com/haowu0802/About/blob/master/Resume_Software_Developer_Hao_Leon_Wu.pdf).)

I've worked with E-commerce giant, travel start-up, marketing data science, and I'm currently working with a few talented developers from my previous companies on our own ideas.

I've had the pleasure of being able to employ __Agile, TDD__ methodologies and work __remotely__ in most of my previous roles, inspired by Remote and Rework from 37signals. 

Who I am
-
I enjoy working with small, family like teams, growing start-up and small business like nursing plants.
 
I'm a life time learner and coder, I started coding since high school, with modding computer games. I'm a standard geek.

I believe in moving forward in small steady steps, in life and in development, learn a little each day, fulfill one unittest at a time.

I became close friends with most of my previous team members, and we enjoy continue working on interesting things even after we no longer are in the same team. For me, the relationship don't stop at being just co-workers.

What I'm looking for
-
A team that is family like, small and strong, backing each other up, toward the same goal.

A place that I can contribute my effort and craft to help making a difference.

A chance to share and learn from others, and improve the craft together.
